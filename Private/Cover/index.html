      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not the most outgoing person, but I thrive in collaborative environments with sharp and driven teammatesâ€”it helps me constantly grow and learn. Unlike many in my generation, I prefer building and showcasing my skills <span class="highlight-text">over socializing.</span> One of my strengths (and sometimes a flaw) is that when I take ownership of a task or product, I <span class="highlight-text">perfect</span> it so thoroughly that there's rarely any room left for improvement or additional features.
      </p>

      <h2>Work Ethics</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that strong <span class="highlight-text">collaboration</span> creates a healthy environment where raising a bug isn't seen as a criticism, but as a valuable contribution. When I report an issue, I want my team to feel confident and even thankfulâ€”because catching a risk early protects our <span class="highlight-text">company's reputation</span> and helps us deliver a more reliable product to the client.
      </p>

      <h2>Work Style</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to my work style, I believe in testing <span class="highlight-text">rigorously</span> and thoroughly to ensure the client never receives a flawed or unreliable product. I approach every test with intensity and precision to uncover even the smallest issues. One of the qualities I take pride in is real-time reportingâ€”because I believe it's one of the most powerful traits of <span class="highlight-text">great tester.</span> It keeps the entire team aligned, informed, and ready to act when it <span class="highlight-text">matters most.</span>
      </p>

      <h2>Work Planning</h2>
      <p>
       Over the past year, I've built a workflow using five key Generative AI sites like Grok, GPT-6, Claude, and Deepseek to speed up testing. This lets me turn <span class="highlight-text">7 days</span> of work into <span class="highlight-text">1 day</span> by connecting docs, testing, and real-time reporting efficiently with my team.
      </p>

      <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand dev workflow, avoid unnecessary questions, save time.</li>
        <li>Built real-time custom reports using HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
        <li>Collaborate effectively with teams through clear communication.</li>
        <li>Used GenAI to finish 7 days' work in just 1 day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I have a habit of turning repetitive manual tasks into efficient systems. Whenever I find myself repeating a process, I build tools or workflows to <span class="highlight-text">automate</span> itâ€”saving time and boosting productivity. This mindset shapes how I plan, approach, and grow through my work. It's not just my habit-it's my way of working and evolving.
