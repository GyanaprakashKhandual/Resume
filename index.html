    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">
            <span class="question-number">1.</span>How would you handle a guest who is upset about a booking error or room issue?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I would stay calm and listen carefully to the guest's concern without interrupting. I'd apologize sincerely for the inconvenience and assure them that I'll do everything I can to resolve the issue quickly. Then I'd check the reservation system, speak to the manager if needed, and offer possible solutions — like an upgrade or a room change — depending on availability. My goal is to turn a negative experience into a positive one.

        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                Once, a guest had left behind a travel document they urgently needed. I personally contacted the courier service and arranged same-day delivery to their next destination. They were very grateful, and it felt great to know I could help reduce their stress during travel.

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">
            <span class="question-number">3.</span>How do you greet guests when they first arrive at the hotel?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I greet each guest with a warm smile and say, "Good [morning/afternoon/evening], welcome to [Hotel Name]. How may I assist you today?" I also make sure to maintain eye contact and use a friendly tone to make them feel genuinely welcomed.

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">
            <span class="question-number">4.</span>Are you familiar with any hotel management software (e.g., Opera, Cloudbeds, etc.)?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                Yes, I have used [Opera/Cloudbeds/eZee/another PMS if applicable]. I'm comfortable with managing check-ins, check-outs, billing, and room availability through the system. If I'm unfamiliar with a specific software, I'm a fast learner and adapt quickly with training.

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">
            <span class="question-number">5.</span>How do you ensure accuracy when handling guest check-ins, check-outs, and billing?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I double-check reservation details and ID at check-in, confirm charges with guests at check-out, and make sure payments and room services are correctly applied to the bill. Accuracy is important, so I always take a moment to verify details before finalizing.

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I stay calm and prioritize tasks based on urgency. I greet every guest with a polite smile, even if they have to wait briefly. If needed, I politely inform them that I'll be with them shortly. Multitasking, staying organized, and keeping a positive attitude helps me manage pressure effectively.

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I would log the issue immediately and contact the appropriate department — either by phone or through the internal system. I'd follow up to make sure the task was completed and then call the guest to confirm that everything is resolved to their satisfaction.

            <span class="question-number">8.</span>What would you do if a guest tried to enter someone else's room claiming it was theirs?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <div class="answer-text">
                I would politely inform the guest that for security reasons, I cannot give access without verifying their identity. I would check the reservation system and ask for ID or a booking reference. Guest safety and privacy are top priorities, so I would follow all security protocols.

            <div class="answer-text">
                I treat all guest information as private. I never share personal or booking details with anyone except the guest or authorized staff. I log out of systems when not in use and ensure that printed materials with sensitive information are handled properly.
